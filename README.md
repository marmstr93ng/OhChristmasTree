# OhChristmasTree
The initial concept for a electronic desk christmas tree.

## Parameters

* Small enough to not be unobtrusive on a desk
* Must resemble a christmas tree (PCB tree shaped)
* Decorated (LEDs as lights, silk screen)
* LED blink pattern controllable
* Portable (battery powered)
* Standable (cross piece stand)
* Complete kit

## Steps
1. Schematic/breadboard prototyping - (think of final pcb manufacturing)
* LED Control - simple patterns - button to cycle through
* reflash capability
* Power - on/off switch
2. PCB Layout

## Future Ideas
* tune making
* custom patterns
* other christmas decoration features
