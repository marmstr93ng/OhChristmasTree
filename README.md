# OhChristmasTree
The initial concept for a electronic desk christmas tree.

## Parameters

* Small enough to not be unobtrusive on a desk
* Must resemble a christmas tree (PCB tree shaped)
* Decorated (LEDs as lights(differnt colours - RGB?), silk screen art, star LED (twinkle?))
* LED blink pattern selectable pattern
* Portable (battery powered)
* Standable (cross piece stand)
* Complete kit

## Steps
1. Schematic/breadboard prototyping - (think of final pcb manufacturing)
* LED Control - simple patterns - button to cycle through
* reflash capability
* Power - on/off switch
2. Model prototype
* Size, Shape, stand mechanics
2. PCB Layout

### Patterns
* Chase (one on at a time up the string of lights)
* FiftyFifty (half on, half off, switch back and forth)
* All (all permanantly on)
* Fade (all fade on and off) - requires power control!
* Pulse (all lights on, alternating lights pulse brighter)

## Future Ideas
* tune making
* custom patterns
* other christmas decoration features
